"Naming Scheme"

    Functions:
        All functions and macros must use camelCase where possible; however, it is allowed
        to add a prefix word followed by an underscore and the function name in camelCase.
        The latter should be used as a last resort when not specifying something like a
        library prefix would make things too ambiguous. Additionally, functions are not
        allowed to start nor end with underscores because it may be interpreted as a
        visibility modifier, when such thing is not really possible.

        Ok:
            - main
            - add2Numbers
            - myFunction
            - anotherReallyLongFunctionName
            - library_myFunction
            - clib_function

        Bad:
            - _fx
            - _
            - MyFunction
            - this_function_is_not_a_library
            - fx_

    Variables:
        Variables are to be named as short and concise as possible but fitting within a
        meaningful english word. For example, it would be innapropriate to rename "rect"
        to just "r", but it is fine to rename "rectangle" to "rect". Additionally, they
        use camelCase but with the exception that underscores ARE NEVER ALLOWED unless it
        is a constant. A constant variable should be all uppercase and each word separated
        with an underscore. However, underscores cannot precede and succeed the name.

        Ok:
            - x
            - someVariable
            - MY_CONSTANT

        Bad:
            - _smallVariable
            - x_
            - ThiS_IsntAcOnstant
            - _

    Types:
        Types should follow a PascalCase formatting and underscores are never allowed. If
        a library name or other prefix word is required, it is just advised to stick that
        word infront of the type name and following PascalCase.

        Ok:
            - MyType
            - Vector2
            - Vec2
            - I32
            - CFloat

        Bad:
            - myType
            - vec2
            - i32
            - _
            - My_Favorite_Type

    Macros:
        Macros depend on the context. A macro that redefines a type (not a function)
        should follow standard naming schemes for a type. On the other hand, if the function
        is either redefining another function or acts like a function-like macro should
        follow the functions naming scheme. However, the exception are for things like FLAG
        macro should follow the naming scheme used for a constant with the exception that
        if they are an include guard, they can have underscores preceding and succeeding.
